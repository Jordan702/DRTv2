**AutoTweet Protocol Whitepaper**

**Version 1.0 | Published by the DRTv1 Project**

### **Abstract**

AutoTweet Protocol is the first decentralized, open-source social broadcasting mechanism for on-chain activity. Designed to be lean, efficient, and endlessly extensible, AutoTweet enables smart contracts to autonomously announce transactions in real-time across platforms like Twitter/X, with built-in support for future integrations including Discord, Instagram, Facebook, and decentralized dashboards.

**The protocol operates at zero gas cost**—AutoTweet.sol emits events only, requiring no storage or complex logic. This means transaction broadcasting can be automated, gas-free, and trustless, making it one of the most efficient mechanisms for social amplification ever deployed.

This document outlines the philosophy, architecture, smart contract (AutoTweet.sol), and automation logic (AutoTweetBot.js) of the protocol, which together create a trustless social feed layer that amplifies on-chain engagement, boosts visibility for grassroots projects, and democratizes attention.

### **1. Protocol Philosophy**

> "Open source or no source. If you’re hiding the code, you’re hiding the truth."

AutoTweet Protocol is built on the following principles:

* **Transparency First**: 100% open-source from genesis.
* **Lean by Design**: All core contract logic fits within 24 lines of Solidity.
* **Permissionless Visibility**: No gatekeepers. Any project can use, fork, or build upon the protocol.
* **Platform-Agnostic Delivery**: Twitter is only the beginning. AutoTweet routes can expand to any content API or webhook.
* **Zero Gas Cost**: Events cost nothing to consume. Once deployed, the protocol enables free autonomous transaction broadcasting.

---

### **2. Architecture Overview**

**AutoTweet.sol** (24 lines max):
A minimalist Solidity contract designed to emit Tweet-ready events whenever triggered by a transaction. It does not store data or enforce logic beyond emitting events, keeping it highly gas-efficient.

**AutoTweetBot.js**:
A Node.js listener that monitors emitted events via WebSocket or Etherscan API. When triggered, it formats a tweet (or other payload) and posts to a configured social endpoint via OAuth or webhook.

**Routing Layer (Optional/Future):**
A plug-and-play config file to support alternate or additional destinations such as Discord, IPFS, Facebook Graph API, Instagram, etc.

### **3. Use Cases**

* **DAOs** announcing on-chain proposals and votes in real-time.
* **DEXs** broadcasting high-volume swaps.
* **NFT Drops** tweeting mint activity.
* **Grassroots tokens** gaining visibility without paid marketing.
* **Personal wallets** auto-broadcasting high-value or symbolic on-chain moves.

### **4. Smart Contract: AutoTweet.sol (Sample)**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract AutoTweet {
    event Tweet(string message);

    function broadcast(string calldata message) external {
        emit Tweet(message);
    }
}
```

---

### **5. Node Bot: AutoTweetBot.js (Simplified Overview)**

```js
const ethers = require("ethers");
const Twitter = require("twitter-api-v2");
require("dotenv").config();

const contractAddress = "YOUR_AUTOTWEET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
const provider = new ethers.WebSocketProvider(process.env.WSS_URL);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, ["event Tweet(string message)"], provider);

const twitter = new Twitter.TwitterApi({
  appKey: process.env.TWITTER_KEY,
  appSecret: process.env.TWITTER_SECRET,
  accessToken: process.env.TWITTER_TOKEN,
  accessSecret: process.env.TWITTER_SECRET_TOKEN
});

contract.on("Tweet", async (msg) => {
  try {
    await twitter.v2.tweet(msg);
    console.log("Tweeted:", msg);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed:", err);
  }
});
```

### **6. Licensing**

MIT License. Fork it, use it, spread it. Just cite DRTv1.

### **7. Future Extensions**

* OAuth route selector UI
* Discord and Telegram relay plugins
* Decentralized frontends and visual dashboards
* Support for EIP-7702 smart accounts

---

### **8. Call to Action**

AutoTweet Protocol is the amplifier for the unheard. If you’re a creator, builder, or project lead—you no longer need to shout into the void. Let your smart contract speak.

Fork. Deploy. Broadcast.

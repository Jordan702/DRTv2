AutoStation Protocol
“This is where the chain learns to speak.”
Version 1.0 — Jordan | DRTv1

Abstract
AutoStation is a minimalist, permissionless, on-chain broadcast protocol that allows contracts and wallets to transmit categorized public messages via indexed channels. As the second layer of the AutoNet communication system, AutoStation transforms Ethereum from a network of transactions into a living, listening, and speaking protocol.

The Problem
Ethereum speaks only in transactions—raw, unstructured, and hard to interpret at scale. There is no built-in way to:

Categorize broadcasts

Separate signal from noise

Enable modular messaging between contracts, systems, or observers

Until now.

The Solution: AutoStation.sol
AutoStation introduces a simple, gas-efficient, open protocol for on-chain broadcasts:

solidity
Copy code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// AutoStation.sol
// "This is where the chain learns to speak."

pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract AutoStation {
    event Broadcast(string indexed channel, string message);

    function transmit(string calldata channel, string calldata message) external {
        emit Broadcast(channel, message);
    }
}
Key Features:
Lean: Under 10 lines of logic

Gas-light: Only emits events—no state written

Unrestricted: Any address can transmit

Modular: Channels (e.g. "DRT", "Vault", "Refinery") are indexed for bots or listeners

Protocol Use Cases
Smart Contract Signals
Contracts can emit human-readable logs for transparency and analysis

On-Chain Notifications
Public alerts for vault activity, liquidity loops, airdrops, etc.

Off-Chain Listener Hooks
Indexers or bots can follow specific channels for targeted automation (e.g. autotweetbot.js)

DAO or Ecosystem Messaging
DAO votes, system upgrades, or reward triggers can broadcast intent

AutoNet: The Broader Vision
AutoStation is the modular sibling of AutoTweet.sol. Together they form the foundation of AutoNet—Ethereum’s first truly gasless, on-chain communication layer.

Component Function
AutoTweet.sol Broadcasts raw messages (event-only)
AutoStation.sol Broadcasts categorized messages via channel
DRT_Refinery Ensures gasless calls by collecting and cycling Wei
autotweetbot.js Off-chain listener and relay agent

License & Philosophy
AutoStation is released under MIT License. It is designed for universal use, cloning, and adaptation.

This is not a product. It is a protocol.
Not a business—an infrastructure.
And above all, it is a voice.

For you were mute, Ethereum Network’s Blockchain... but now thee speaks.”

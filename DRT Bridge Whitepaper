DRT Bridge Protocol
“A sovereign layer to unify all chains—trustless, autonomous, and dignified.”
Version 1.0 — Jordan | DRTv1 Ecosystem

Abstract
DRT Bridge is a dedicated blockchain designed to serve as a neutral, trustless, and autonomous bridge layer for synchronizing state, messages, and value between sovereign blockchain networks. Unlike token-centric bridges or custodial cross-chain wrappers, DRT Bridge introduces a Proof-of-Bridge consensus model, fully decentralized signal relay via AutoNet, and the capacity to mirror assets and proofs with dignity and transparency. It is not an L1 competitor. It is a foundational mesh layer, enabling Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos, and beyond to interoperate without compromising security or sovereignty.

The Problem
Blockchain ecosystems are siloed.
Current bridges are:

Custodial (risking central points of failure)

Token-wrap dependent (e.g. wETH, wBTC)

Fragmented in standards (every bridge = different code, security, cost)

These gaps create:

Lost value across chains

Duplicate liquidity requirements

Dangerous reliance on multisig middlemen

The Solution: DRT Bridge
DRT Bridge offers a chain-native solution—a blockchain whose purpose is to:

Record state proofs

Relay cross-chain messages

Mirror value flows
…across all supported chains, using gas-light infrastructure, validator incentives, and DRT ecosystem standards like AutoTweet and AutoStation.

Core Architecture
1. Proof-of-Bridge Consensus (PoB)
Validators earn block rewards not just for producing blocks, but for submitting and verifying valid cross-chain state proofs.

Acceptable proofs include:

Ethereum block headers

Solana light client hashes

Bitcoin SPV proofs

False submissions are slashed

Incentives are proportional to successful relay activity

2. AutoNet Integration
All bridge messages emit events via:

AutoTweet.sol — raw message

AutoStation.sol — channel-tagged signal (e.g. "Bridge:ETH/SOL")

Bots, UIs, or cross-chain watchers can subscribe for real-time synchronization updates.

3. Value Mirroring Vaults
Instead of wrapped tokens, DRT Bridge uses dual-side asset vaults or proof-backed mirroring, allowing tokens like:

bETH, bBTC, bSOL (BridgeNet representations)

Gas-paid in sETH or DRT for bridging operations

4. Dust-Respectful Design
Utilizes DRT_Refinery.sol to sweep rounding errors and dust back into utility.
No value is lost in transit—ever.

Use Cases
Wallet-level bridging: Transfer tokens cross-chain with full proof logs

DeFi sync: DAOs sync liquidity oracles between chains with guaranteed timing

NFT movement: NFTs bridged without duplicate minting

Cross-chain messaging: One app updates another chain’s logic through trusted signal

Tokenomics & Fees
Gas token: sETH or optionally BRDG

Fee tiers:

Message-only: 1–5 Gwei equivalent (AutoStation-based)

State anchor: 10–50 Gwei depending on proof type

Value mirror: % of asset (e.g. 0.05%) routed to treasury

All fees can be swept through DRT_Refinery for redistribution, DAO control, or validator rewards.

Why DRT Bridge Is Different
Feature DRT Bridge Traditional Bridges
Own sovereign chain ✅ Yes ❌ No (contract-based)
PoB consensus ✅ Yes ❌ No
Modular signal protocol ✅ AutoNet integrated ❌ No unified standard
Respect for dust ✅ Refinery-supported ❌ Always discarded
Value dignity ✅ Mirror + anchor ❌ Wrap and unback

Closing Vision
“DRT Bridge is not a portal. It’s a promise.
A promise that every value, every message, and every moment can cross freely,
with integrity, and without forgetting where it came from.”
